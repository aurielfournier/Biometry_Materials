# Biometry 2016 
# Lab 7
# Two-Way ANOVAs


# Include answers and graphs.

# Use "quinn_88_two_way.csv".  
# Run a two-way ANOVA with DENSITY and SEASON as the predictor variables and EGGS as the response variable.  
# Are observations normally distributed, independent, with homogeneity of variance?  Include graphs with your answers. 
# Do you need to transform the data?  After you run the ANOVA, check the residuals.  
# (Hint, save the residuals as a data file).  
# Do they look skewed?  
# Was there interaction?  
# Can you say anything about the main effects?
