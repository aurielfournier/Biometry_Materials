# ANCOVA IN R
# model=aov(response ~ covariate + factorvariable, data=object)


# Using the data in "partridge_ANCOVA.csv", answer the following questions.  
# The authors were interested in the effect of the number of mating partners (TREATMEN) on fruitfly longevity (LONGEV).  
# Thorax length (THORAX), a measure of fruitfly size, was also measured and is used as a covariate. 

# If you wanted to determine whether the treatment had an effect on longevity, how would you do it? 
# Run an ANOVA to answer the above question.
# Does the data meet the assumptions of the test?  
# How can you tell?  
# What could you do if the data did not meet the assumptions?


# Now do an ANCOVA using the covariate (THORAX).  
# Make sure you test the assumptions first.  
# What does the corresponding ANCOVA table tell you?  Interpret it for me.  
# What is a covariate and why bother with it?
