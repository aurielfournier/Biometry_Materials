# Correlation and Regression


# Using the data in "seasons.csv", answer the following questions.  
# This file contains many abiotic and biotic variables that were collected in three different Ozark streams (see SITE).  
# The following questions pertain to correlation and regression on variables in this dataset.

#function for correlation
# cor(x, y = NULL, method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"))

# fuction for a regression
# lm(formula, data)

# If you were interested in determining the degree of association among the following variables (Area, Cover, Canopy, Depth, Substrate, Totdens, Richness), how would you do it?

# What is the difference between regression and correlation?  
# Does the data meet the assumptions of the test?  
# How can you tell?  
# What could you do if the data did not meet the assumptions?


# Carry out the appropriate test for the above data, assuming that they meet the assumptions of the test.  
# Which correlations are significant?  
# What does a significant correlation mean?  

# For example, explain what the relationship is between substrate and depth, and between richness and totdens.  

# Is there a problem with looking at so many tests (remember experimentwise and comparisonwise type I error rates)?


# What are the assumptions of linear regression (see Quinn and Keough and my notes)?  
# I want to know if Totdens and Richness can be predicted by Volume. 
# Do the appropriate tests and report your results. 
# What do they mean?  
# Are the regressions significant?  
# What does a significant regression mean?  
# What are least squares?
