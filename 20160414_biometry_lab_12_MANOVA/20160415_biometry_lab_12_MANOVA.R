# MANOVA

# responses <- cbind(object$response1, object$response2)
# manova(responses ~ object$covariate)

# Use the data in "fish_density.csv"  
# The file contains some data from a recent study.  
# We are interested in whether habitat differs among seasons and streams in Ozark streams.  
# We collected habitat data three streams each in Boston Mountains and Ozark Highlands ecoregions.  
# I come to you as my statistician with my data file for 2002 and ask you whether there are differences in stream habitat volume (VOLUME) and current velocity (VELOCITY) among seasons (SEASON$ or SEASNUM) and streams (STREAM$ or STREAMNUM) in the Boston Mountain ecoregion (select STREAMNUM<=3). 

# What are the assumptions for this type of test and how can you check for them?  
# Run the MANOVAs and interpret the output.  
# If there are differences, what groups are different?
